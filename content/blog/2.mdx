The most difficult thing for me, and I assume for many others as well, is to stay motivated and focused as someone who has ADHD.  No matter where you currently find yourself in life, maintaining motivation can be challenging. Whether you're engaged in studying, participating in a boot camp, fulfilling tasks as an employee, working on a side project, or running your own business, there are instances when everyone faces difficulties in sustaining momentum. Thankfully, we are not alone in this struggle. Many individuals encounter similar situations, and each person has their own methods for addressing this challenge. 

Here are a few tips for you to keep on going. 

## Always remember your goals 🎯

Frequently, the reason we struggle to stay motivated and question our work is that we often forget our initial goals. Consider the motivation behind starting a specific side project, for example, or joining the gym. It doesn't necessarily have to be technical related.

Keep track of your goals. Remember your big picture and the big “why” for the things you want to do. Is it about the money? Are you working on something for fun or do you want to learn something new?

Try to imagine how it feels like when you achieve your goals and try to create the world with this goal achieved in your head. Sounds a bit esoteric, I know, but it works!

The desire to reach your goals has to be strong. Think about your reasons every single day and it will be a lot easier to stay on track.

## Take the risks ✔️
As Gary Vaynerchuk wisely puts it, 'You're better off being wrong ten times and being right three than trying only three times and always getting it right.' This advice isn't just for business; it applies to your side projects and daily tasks. 

Fear often leaves projects unfinished, hidden away in hopes of finding something better. But truth be told, you'll never know unless you take the risks. Even if outcomes differ, the journey, fueled by passion and curiosity, is worth it. 

Don't let fear hold you back—take the risks and savor the lessons learned.

## Break it Down 📋
Divide your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks if you are feeling overwhelmed or if you feel like do not know where and how to start. This way, you can focus on one piece at a time, making the overall process less overwhelming.

## Find Your Optimal Study Time ⌛
Identify the time of day when you're most alert and focused; for example, in my case, my peak time is betweeen 7-8 PM. It is important to schedule your studying or coding sessions during these peak hours to enhance productivity.

## Create a Distraction-Free Zone 🐱‍💻
Minimise potential distractions by setting up a dedicated workspace. Turn off notifications on your phone or anything that will distract you, and create an environment that helps you concentrate.

## Utilise Time Management Techniques 🍅
Adopt time-blocking or the Pomodoro technique. Work in focused intervals with short breaks to maintain productivity without feeling overwhelmed.

## Document your results ✍🏼
The last thing I recommend doing to stay motivated is documenting your ALL your work, it does not matter if it is small or big tasks. Give journaling a try. Sit down every month, week or even every single day and think about all the work you have already accomplished. You might be surprised.

Look at how far you’ve already come with your side project. Wouldn’t it be a shame if you just stop here? Move on and finish it.

Get these things in your head, write them down, and it’ll be a lot easier to continue with your work.

## Give yourself a REWARD 🥳
Last but not least, give yourself a reward. Like animals, if you give them a treat, they will listen. We need some treats as well. Instead of playing games all day or eating unhealthy food, just because you feel like it. Use it as a treat. Only give yourself that reward when you complete a task.
For example, I will buy myself my favourite coffee and desserts, whenever I complete my tasks for a day. Have your own treat and it will surprise you. :>


Staying motivated when learning may present challenges, but with the right strategies, staying motivated is within reach. Embrace your unique learning style, be patient with yourself, and remember that every step forward is a step toward mastering the world of coding. Happy coding!
