Hello, everyone! I'm excited to share my journey and the reasons behind my decision to pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence (AI) this September 2024. My path has been shaped by a unique blend of entrepreneurial spirit, technical expertise, and a deep-seated passion for innovation.

Upon graduating, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, establishing a freelance business where I collaborated with a team of professionals to apply our skills in developing business solutions for various clients, primarily in the healthcare sector. My projects ranged from web and mobile development to designing and implementing business applications. This experience honed my technical skills, project management abilities, and understanding of client requirements, allowing me to deliver effective solutions.

Additionally, my interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) grew as I sought to understand user behavior and enhance the user experience for the app. As someone with a hearing impairment myself, I am eager to explore Human-Centric Computing with the aid of AI tools that offer more precise and dependable support for individuals with hearing difficulties. This dual interest in AI and Human-Centric Computing fuels my aspiration to develop innovative solutions that tackle real-world challenges and enhance overall quality of life. 

Pursuing a Master's in AI is more than an academic milestone; it's an opportunity to contribute to a
