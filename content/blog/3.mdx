Hello, everyone! I'm excited to share my journey and the reasons behind my decision to pursue a Master's in Artificial Intelligence (AI) this September 2024. 

Upon graduating, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, establishing a Blue Cloud IT Solution freelance business where I collaborated with a team of professionals to apply our skills in developing business solutions for various clients, primarily in the healthcare sector. My projects have ranged from web and mobile development to designing and implementing business applications. This experience expanded my technical skills across different technologies used by various companies through implementing third-party APIs enhancing frontend design and user interface (UI) design for better user experiences. I have also learned how to manage projects, understand client requirements, and deliver effective solutions. 

My interest in Artificial Intelligence was sparked during my entrepreneurial endeavours as I observed its growing impact on enhancing business products, such as when I saw a football club in the project-gathering phase, planning to implement machine learning for performance metrics analysis. I became intrigued by how they would carry out the implementation. Furthermore, I worked with a healthcare provider to redesign an app in multiple devices for care home residents with hearing impairments relying on speech-to-text. During my role as user interface designer focused on enhancing the app's user experience and accessibility, I observed its shortcomings, prompting me to explore AI's potential to significantly improve accessibility and accuracy

My interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) grew as I sought to enhance user experiences, particularly with apps like Rely UK, designed for individuals with hearing impairments. However, the limitations in Rely UK's transcription accuracy revealed a critical need for improvement. This experience drove my passion to explore AI-driven solutions for more reliable support. I aim to develop innovations that address real-world challenges, improving the quality of life for those with hearing impairments.

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog.
